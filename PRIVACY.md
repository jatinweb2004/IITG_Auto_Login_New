# Privacy Policy – IITG AutoLogin Extension

IITG AutoLogin is a Chrome Extension that automates the login process for the IITG campus Wi-Fi captive portal.

- The extension stores your IITG username and password **locally** in Chrome’s `chrome.storage.sync` for the sole purpose of logging you into the campus Wi-Fi.
- No data is collected, transmitted, or shared with any third-party servers.
- The extension only communicates with the IITG captive portal domain (`https://agnigarh.iitg.ac.in:1442/`) to perform login/logout actions.
- We do not sell, transfer, or use your data for any purpose other than the intended auto-login functionality.
- Your credentials remain under your control and can be removed at any time by clearing the extension’s saved data.
